I learned the difference between regular git pull commands and pull requests.

I'm 23 years old and I'm currently about to be a Computer Science Junior. This will be the second degree I pursue after recently getting my biochemistry degree.

I realized that the pre-medical route after not felling fulfilled with my chemistry degree, I realized when I dived into the world of coding that I had passion for the Computer Science. It's a constantly evolving field and I enjoy every minute of it.
